# Snake

I built snake for the command line in python.

## Usage

Go into a terminal, type:
```
git clone git@github.com:maximo12345678901/Snake.git
```
in whatever directory you like.
Then move into the cloned directory.  
Then type:
```
python snake.py
```
If there is a ModuleNotFoundError, go ahead and install the following modules:
- keyboard

When you have done so, you can go ahead and play the game.

## How to play

When the game starts, it will ask you to give an x and a y, this is the width and height of the playing field.

After that, the controlls are WASD or arrow keys to move.

The goal is to eat apples, which are drawn as "( )"  
Do not bump into the walls nor yourself
